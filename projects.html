    <h2> Projects: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Book Cataloger (mobile app that allows people to keep track of books by a number of categories.
        Books can be entered by scanning the barcode or searching, the book data is then automatically gathered.) </li>
        <li> Mind Blown (does it have to be CS projects? :P A lithograph print I created of two skulls with
        squares bursting out of a head of one, and spilling out of the eyes of the other. It can be viewed on the link below.) </li>
        <li> Family Map Client (the CS assignment that involved connecting to a mobile app to a database. Also, a tremendous pain.) </li>
        <li> Fire Watch (Created a medicore website that roughly estimates the fire risk for a given area. Inspired after 
        the wake of fires that devestated much of California.)</li>
